Python-C++ Config Loader

This library makes it easy to populate structs or classes defined in C++ by loading data from Python files.

Imagine Python syntax and expressiveness where INI files might have been used before.

For example usage, see the "test" directory, especially PyConfig.test.cpp and .py.

Depends on Boost Python and the Python C API (packages "boost-devel" and "python-devel" if you use yum).
